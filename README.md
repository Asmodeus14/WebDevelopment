# Honkai: Star Rail - Dummy Dark Website Showcase

This project is a front-end showcase inspired by the *Honkai: Star Rail* game. It is designed to demonstrate my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on creating an engaging, visually immersive website experience.

## Features

- **Dark Theme Design**: The website mimics the aesthetic of *Honkai: Star Rail*, utilizing a dark-themed interface for a modern, sleek look.
- **Media Embedding**: Includes video backgrounds and social media integration for a dynamic user experience.
- **Interactive Navigation**: Dropdown menus, hover effects, and smooth transitions create a user-friendly navigation system.
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for different screen sizes to ensure a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
- **Image Gallery**: Displays character and game-related images from *Honkai: Star Rail*, providing an interactive and rich visual display.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structuring the content and layout of the site.
- **CSS**: Styling the interface with a modern dark theme, ensuring responsiveness and smooth animations.
- **JavaScript**: Placeholder for future back-end integration (e.g., dynamic content loading, user login functionality).
  
> While I’ve learned JavaScript, I haven’t implemented it due to workload constraints. If there’s enough interest, I can integrate backend functionality (such as user accounts or content management).

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Asmodeus14/Webdevelopment

2. Open the `GameWb.html` file in your browser to view the website.

## Future Features

If there is enough interest, I plan to implement the following features:
- **Back-End Integration**: To manage user accounts, data storage, and dynamic content.
- **Enhanced JavaScript Interactivity**: Add interactive elements such as real-time notifications, live updates, and personalized content.
